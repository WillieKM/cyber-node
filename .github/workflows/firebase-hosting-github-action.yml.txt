# We need to switch back to the 'main' branch to commit the config file
git checkout main

# Stage the new folder and file
git add .github

# Commit the file
git commit -m feat Final WIF workflow configuration

# Push the critical file to GitHub's main branch
git push

Let me know the final output of the `git push` command! That is the moment the deployment will finally start working.
